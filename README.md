[30 Days of JavaScript by Asabeneh Yetayeh] (https://30dayjavascript.js.org/)

### Summary

I started my JavaScript journey with this helpful challenge. Without prior knowledge of javascript i was able to grasp and solve some exercise on each day.

This took me about 2months(May/June 2023) to solve to the best of my knowledge and from what i learnt, not all exercises were attempted though.

I didn't want to make this repository but i realised i had to because one day i would like to look back at where i started and be proud of myself becoming a self taught Software EnginnerüòÅ.

JULY & AUGUST was spent on further learning javascript now with John Smilga's Udemy tutorial videos and building the projects in it.
